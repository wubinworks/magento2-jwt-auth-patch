**Fix the JWT authentication vulnerability on certain Magento 2 versions. Deny tokens issued by old encryption key. If you cannot upgrade Magento or cannot apply the official patch, try this one.**

## Background

In September 2024, an authentication vulnerability was revealed on multiple Magento versions and those versions are identified that a new module `Magento_JwtUserToken` is employed.

Tokens(especially Admin Tokens) issued by **old** encryption key remains valid even if a new key is added. The vulnerability is caused by a bug in the above mentioned module. Attacker who once obtained a key can have **persistent** Admin level WebAPI access to the victim's store.

#### CVE-2024-34102(aka Cosmic Sting) Secondary Disaster

By exploiting CVE-2024-34102, the attacker can steal the encryption key and craft "valid" Admin Token.  
A key rotation without fixing this vulnerability cannot deny the attacker's Admin level access.

#### Do I really need this patch ?

If your store is already hacked or you are unsure if it is, then you **should assume** the encryption key is leaked. Performing an encryption key rotation is very urgent.

## Rotate Encryption Key

_Note1: Perform the key rotation **after** installing this patch(extension)._  
_Note2: Encryption keys are stored in `app/etc/env.php` `crypt/key` path, but **do not delete old keys after rotation**._

 - Login to Admin Panel
 - Go to `System > Other Settings > Manage Encryption Key`
 - Change `Auto-generate a Key` to `Yes` and then `Change Encryption Key`

More details, including command line methods, are in this [blog post](https://www.wubinworks.com/blog/post/magento2-rotate-encryption-key).
